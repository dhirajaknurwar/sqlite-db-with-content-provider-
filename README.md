Android: Sqlite Db with Content Provider

<pre>
Storing your data in a database is one good way to persist your data, but thereâ€™s a caveat in 
Android-databases created 
in Android are visible only to the application that created them. 
That is to say, a SQLite database created on Android
by one application is usable only by that application, not by other applications.

So, if you need to share data between applications, you need to use the content provider
model as recommended in Android.

<pre> This demonstration include :

Sorting data in DB through Content Provider, Accessing data from SQLITE DB through Content provider using AsyncTask.
Set Alarm to download some data in background service and store in SQLITE DB.

All SQLITE DB operation doing in AsyncTask.
